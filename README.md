# ECE4710J
These are my project and final challenge of ECE4710J. This is the second course including machine learning topics I have taken at JI. Super interesting and also a little challenging. Prof. Zhang is super kind and really helpful.

**JI student should take the honor code seriously and should never violate the honor code under any situation.**
